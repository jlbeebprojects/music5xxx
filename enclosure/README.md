## Hybrid Music 5000/3000/2000 BBC Microcomputer synthesiser clone project enclosure  

This is a design for a 3d printed enclosure for the clone Music5000 system. It is designed using Fusion360. STL files are provided for printing, as well as a Fusion360 file for modification.

It is designed for 3 PCBs separated using 15mm brass M-F spacers. The lowest PCB is configured as an M3000 module without the power supply components. The middle PCB is configured as a M5000 module. PCB headers and pins connect power between the two lower PCBs. The upper PCB is a [M2xxx Midi module](https://github.com/jlbeebprojects/music2xxx). A pair of wires connect to the 5V header on the M5000 PCB. 

I printed mine using 0.3mm layer height using PLA plastic. Make sure you have good bed adhesion to prevent warping due to the large flat contact areas. Note the design includes thin support struts to support the 1Mhz port and Midi output apertures. Clip these off before assembling the unit.

Insert and tighten the 15V AC power socket before installing the PCBs.
